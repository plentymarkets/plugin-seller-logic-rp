# SellerLogic Amazon Repricer 

It is just like Google: Everyone wants to be at the top of the first page, but the algorithms that determine the rankings are top secret and constantly changing. The goal of most Amazon sellers is to win the BuyBox. How can you win the BuyBox while selling for the highest possible price?
Various performance factors, including product availability, customer satisfaction, a low return quota and others can help you win the shopping cart race. You cannot influence these factors directly – but you can influence the price of your product. This is where SellerLogic’s Amazon Repricer comes into play. Based on the current performance, it determines the price necessary to win the BuyBox. Once this goal is achieved, it works automatically for the second goal of price optimization: selling at the best price. This way, you sell at the best price in the BuyBox, not the lowest.  In this context, it is important to know how the market develops. Our repricer is based on intelligent, algorithmic and big data based technology that optimizes your prices depending on the price changes of competitors. 

## What makes SellerLogic better than ordinary repricers? 

SellerLogic’s repricer is different from conventional Amazon Repricers in that they typically work with rule optimization. They try to trigger sales with static minimum prices. The instruction goes: “Our product should always be 5 cents cheaper than the cheapest one.” A static rule like this does not guarantee getting into the BuyBox since a number of other performance factors play a decisive role. 

## The principle of dynamic adjustment 

That is why SellerLogic uses dynamic price adjustment. You can choose from different levels of automation. The settings range from fully automatic optimization to the BuyBox with the highest price through optimization to position (e.g. to achieve targeted awareness or simply to be present) to sales-based strategies for manufacturers and private label providers. 

SellerLogic’s Amazon Repricer offers you several options to optimize your Amazon business. Of course, you can change your strategy at any time and adapt it to your wishes. You can set the price upper and lower limit by statically specifying the values, or let us dynamically calculate the values for you based on the desired margin.   With the push strategy, you can control the price of a product based on order numbers. If sales are lower than expected, turn the price screw down to create a higher buying incentive. Or up the prices when demand is high. The daily push strategy allows you to offer sales based on one day's sales figures. For example, you can increase the price at midnight or reset it to the starting price at a pre-defined time. 

## Facts 

Amazon generates about 53% of e-commerce sales in Germany. (Source: t3n magazine) 
Sellers that offer the same products have to prevail over the competition by winning the BuyBox as quickly as possible and staying in it for as long as possible. 
Amazon does not provide sellers with any support or ways of optimization for dynamic sales.

- Say goodbye to costly price dumping. 
- SellerLogic is infinitely scalable in both sales processes and volumes. 

## Flexible and fair pricing 

The costs depend on the number of countries you sell to. The number of SKUs you offer at Amazon also affects the prices.

SellerLogic offers for the "Repricer" a free trial access for 14 days. All functions are available without restriction. If the test is convincing, you can conclude a contract, either for 3, 6, 12 or 24 months. The longer the contract, the cheaper it becomes, whereby the costs for using SellerLogic also depend on the number of products (SKUs) in the Amazon shop. Between 16 Euro per month (up to 100 products; contract duration 2 years) and 1,999 Euro per month (up to 1 million products; duration 3 months) the price range is sufficient. The monthly fee always depends on the current number of listed SKUs, i.e. it adjusts automatically and dynamically.
